The Java program contains a class named Solution with a method solution(String T). This method takes a string T as input, which represents a patient’s body temperature in Celsius. It then converts this string to a double and checks which range the temperature falls into. Depending on the range, it returns the corresponding body temperature state:

If the temperature is below 35.0°C, it returns “hypothermia”.
If the temperature is at least 35.0°C and at most 37.5°C, it returns “normal”.
If the temperature is above 37.5°C and at most 40.0°C, it returns “fever”.
If the temperature is above 40.0°C, it returns “hyperpyrexia”.
In the main method, I created an instance of the Solution class and call the solution method with different test inputs. The output of each test is printed to the console.

"34.5"
"35.0"
"37.6"
"41.0"
