Consider an "Order" table with the following columns: order_id, customer_id, order_date, order_amount.
"Customer" table with the following columns: customer_id, customer_name, is_active, create_date
Write SQL queries to perform the following tasks:

Retrieve all orders from the Order table.
Expected result: ORDER_ID, ORDER_DATE, ORDER_AMOUNT

SELECT ORDER_ID, ORDER_DATE, ORDER_AMOUNT
FROM Order;

Retrieve orders placed by a specific customer (customer id 1000).
Expected result: CUSTOMER_NAME, ORDER_ID, ORDER_DATE, ORDER_AMOUNT

SELECT C.CUSTOMER_NAME, O.ORDER_ID, O.ORDER_DATE, 0.ORDER_AMOUNT
FROM Order O
JOIN Customer C ON O.Customer_ID = C.Customer_ID
WHERE O+.Customer_ID = 1000

Retrieve orders placed in the last month (date must not be hard coded) by active customers.
expected result:ORDER_ID, ORDER_DATE

SELECT ORDER_ID, ORDER_DATE
FROM Order
WHERE ORDER_DATE >= DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE())
AND ORDER_DATE <= GETDATE()
AND CUSTOMER_ID IN (SELECT CUSTOMER_ID FROM Customer WHERE IS_ACTIVE = 1);

Retrieve the total amount spent on all orders by each active customer.
expected result: CUSTOMER_NAME, TOTAL AMOUNT

SELECT C.CUSTOMER_NAME, SUM(O.ORDER_AMOUNT) AS TOTAL_AMOUNT
FROM Order O
JOIN Customer C ON O.CUSTOMER_ID = C.CUSTOMER_ID
WHERE C.IS_ACTIVE = 1
GROUP BY C.CUSTOMER_NAME;

Retrieve the name of the customer who has spent the highest total amount of order.
expected result: CUSTOMER_NAME, TOTAL AMOUNT

SELECT TOP 1 C.CUSTOMER_NAME, SUM(O.ORDER_AMOUNT) AS TOTAL_AMOUNT
FROM Order O
JOIN Customer C ON O.CUSTOMER_ID = C.CUSTOMER_ID
GROUP BY C.CUSTOMER_NAME
GROUP BY TOTAL_AMOUNT DESC;

Retrieve the total number of orders placed each year.
expected result: YEAR, ORDER_COUNT

SELECT YEAR(O.ORDER_DATE) AS YEAR, COUNT(*) AS ORDER_COUNT
FROM Order O
GROUP BY YEAR(O.ORDER_DATE);

Remove all the customers who were created last year and whose customer_id starts with 'X'.

DELETE FROM Customer
WHERE YEAR(CREATE_DATE) = YEAR(GETDATE()) - 1
AND CUSTOMER_ID LIKE 'X%';
